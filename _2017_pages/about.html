      <p>The Ontario Aerospace Competition (ONTAC) is a student-run event held in Erindale Park, Mississauga. Lasting a full day, we aim to make this event an educational excursion for local physics classes as well as a challenge for any students willing to try their hand at building model aircraft.<br><br>ONTAC is aimed at high school students who want to explore building vehicles out of easily accessible materials and electronics, and learn about the aerospace field in a unique hands-on manner. We want people to innovate and reach the upper bounds of speed, height, and investigation while keeping the projects inexpensive and small scale.<br><br>Attending ONTAC will be a unique opportunity for the high school experience, because Canada places heavy restrictions on RC vehicles - which bars it off from people who just want to get into it. Additionally, it serves as a way for students to come back from the COVID-19 pandemic and make back the STEM experience they lost from tournament cancellations between 2020 and 2022.<br><br>By featuring a presentation section during the event, we aim to help teams build their public speaking skills and grow more confidence for when it matters in the future. We also want to accustom students to working on design projects in these small teams so they can grasp the importance of roles and proper communication.<br><br>There really are endless possibilities for what teams can make, and the learning experiences from this event will be unparalleled. We hope that through this exciting challenge that students will be able to see some amazing things take the sky, as well as understand aerospace at a whole new level.<br><br>We are so excited to make this event happen and can’t wait for the event day to arrive! We wish the best of luck to all the teams participating!</p>
