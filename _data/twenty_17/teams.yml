  description: My name is David Mota Bustamante, and I am a senior at the Woodlands Secondary School, located in Mississauga, Ontario. I have always been a fan of robotics and aerospace, and have spent most of my life building, programming, and designing things. Most of my experiences in robotics/aerospace have been through competitions in FIRST, WRO, and VEX as well as personal engineering projects such as designing/building computers, planes, and rockets.  In my free time, I enjoy doing exercise and flying remote control planes. I'm also the only one who didn't use a headshot for this.

  description: Hi, I'm Jack. I'm in my junior year of highschool at Woodlands Secondary. To begin, I'd like you all to know that I'm thrilled I got to help organize this event. I've always loved making cool things, like the robots that I built and programmed in a bunch of different competitions such as FLL, WRO, VEX, and FRC. I'm really excited to see what you all come up with! In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, binging shows, and going out with my friends. Biking on the waterfront trail is especially fun. Hope to see you all at the Ontario Aerospace Competiton!
