  topic: "Scala: End Game"
  description: "Scala 3 is the largest revision of the programming language in recent history, and is rapidly nearing release. With Kotlin on the rise and the containerized world drifting away from the JVM, developers everywhere are wondering what the future holds for Scala.

In this sequel and conclusion to Scala’s Last Infinity War (Scalapeno 2018), John A. De Goes and Wiem Zine Elabidine take to the stage to present a compelling and inspiring vision for the Scala programming language, ecosystem, and community.

Attendees will learn about powerful new simplifications coming to Scala 3; new libraries pushing Scala to the forefront of async, concurrent, and distributed programming; and new hope that the Scala community will move beyond past civil wars, and assemble together, diverse but united by a common passion for using a powerful language to take on the hard problems of modern application development."

  topic: "xs: a collections cli"
  description: "The pastiche of command line tools we utilize to process text can be
reimagined more coherently as collections operations, where the
collection is a sequence of strings, or a view imposed on a sequence of
strings. The tool I present here has simplified my life in this regard.
It offers a highly concise way to perform chains of collections
operations (e.g. take/takeRight, drop/dropRight, slice, map, filter)
with all of them designed to flourish as much as anything can amongst
the grim ad hoc reality of unix pipelines. I call it xs."

  topic: The many faces of modularity
  description: "Functional Programming is on the rise and many
  programmers fall in love with the idea that they can build well-behaved programs from small, well-understood, functions.
However our community is still wondering how to best build large applications and services.
Many techniques co-exist nowadays: functions-only, MTL, effects, Tagless-final, ReaderT pattern, dependency injection...
This can be so confusing for newcomers.
This talk will take a 'zoom out' approach and come back to what we are really after: modularity.
We will embark on a 'modularity tour':
<p>* Why is it so important to have modular programs?</p>
<p>* Why is it so hard to achieve modularity?</p>
<p>* What can we expect from today's techniques?</p>
<p>* What can we hope from the ongoing research?</p>
In the end the attendants should go out the talk
with a renewed interest for seeing their programs as Lego bricks that they can assemble with childlike  pleasure!"

  topic: Fancy (Z)Streams for Fancy Programs
  description: "Streams are a declarative, high-level abstraction for representing
many types of programs. In particular, purely functional streams built
on top of effect monads are a joy to use for constructing performant,
resource safe and concurrent applications. Many patterns written
using manual concurrency management can be elegantly represented using
streams, resulting in concise and correct programs.

ZIO's streams library was introduced at the end of 2018. Since then,
it has gone through several iterations, improving compositionality,
resource saftey and support for concurrency. In this talk, we will
show how, by using the ZStream and ZSink data types, we can quickly
construct concurrent and resource-safe applications. We will also look
at the internal representation of ZStream to gain a deeper
understanding of how it works under the hood. No prior experience with
the library is required!"

  topic: Hyperpragmatic pure FP testing with distage-testkit
  description: "Having a proper test suite can turn ongoing application
  maintenance and development into pure joy – the best tests check meaningful properties,
  not the implementation details, and hold no impliict assumptions about their
  test environment - every test case must be self-contained and portable.
  To ensure that tests are free of implementation details and environment dependency,
  we may simply run them in a different test environment,
  with different implementations of components.
  But the boileplate and manual work involved in rewiring components, writing hardcoded
  fixtures and setting up different test environments make this very hard to do at scale.
  To tackle this problem we've created distage & distage-testkit, distage-testkit gives you the
  following superpowers:
<p>* ability to easily swap out individual components or entire test environments </p>
<p>* principled & leak-free control of global resources for integration testing – docker containers, DBs, DDLs</p>
<p>* execute effects or allocate resources per-test, e.g. generate random fixtures per-test</p>
<p>* first-class testing of functional effects</p>
<p>* write tests as lambdas – access test fixtures via parameters or ZIO Environment</p>
<p>...and more! We'll also discuss general testing practices and what really distinguishes good tests from great tests.</p>"

  topic: "Unveiling ZIO Test: A New Testing Library for Functional Scala"
  description: "As we gain more and more expressive ways of writing software using functional effects, we also need tools to test that software.
  Unfortunately, existing testing frameworks have not kept up with the evolution of modern functional effect systems.
  In this talk, Adam Fraser will first show how existing testing frameworks force developers to treat effects as 'second class citizens',
  and then demonstrate the power of treating effects as first class values.
  Then Adam will introduce ZIO Test, a next generation testing
  library co-developed by Adam that takes this idea to its logical conclusion by making every test an effect. Finally, Adam will demonstrate how this functional approach makes many “hard” problems in testing easy, and completely unifies features like property-based testing that used to require separate libraries.
Whether you use Future, Monix, Cats IO, or ZIO, come discover the power of purely functional testing with ZIO Test!"

  description: "Over the past couple of years, we have witnessed the emergence of functional effect
libraries. While most of them successfully conquered single node computation, providing
better solutions for concurrency than actors, distributed computation is still untamed.
In this talk, Dejan and Przemyslaw will introduce their work on ZIO Keeper, a principled
functional library for building distributed systems. They will present the building blocks
of this library, explain the design choices behind them, and demonstrate their capabilities.
Finally, they will wrap up the talk with a glimpse to the future, sketching the roadmap to a

  topic: Ray Tracing with ZIO
  description: "In the FP realm in Scala, tagless-final is a popular technique to have injectable, testable, extensible components. An alternative technique is the usage of environmental effects, which provides similar benefits, with a lower entry barrier and improved type-inference.
During this talk, we will build a fully testable ray tracer in Scala with ZIO using environmental effects. We will also explore some useful combinators available in ZIO to build concurrent, resource-safe applications."

  topic: Composition using Arrows and Monoidal Categories
  description: "Monads and monad-like types are the perfect fit for many eDSLs in functional programming. However, sometimes we need to enforce stricter language requirements, such as static process analysis, minimizing allocations, purity, totality and linear-like semantics (exactly-one use). In such cases, Arrows and Symmetric Monoidal Categories (SMC) may be a fine choice, still they are generally avoided because manual composition is difficult. We present a WIP macro library volga that is for arrows and SMC what is for-comprehension is for monads. We will discuss use cases applicability of Arrows and SMC, as well as syntax and semantics of volga."

promises free generators, free shrinking and cheap properties, to allow
property-based testing to fulfill its true potential."

  topic: Prototyping the Future with Functional Scala
  description: "A few months ago I quit my job and became an independent contractor so that I could help companies build great applications using Scala.
  My first client, a medium sized company, which develops SAAS products for universities and research organizations, asked me to help the team to develop
  a kick-ass prototype within a very limited period of time.
In this talk I will explain how the team came to the conclusion that Scala is a good solution for the job of building a worker for preparing,
executing and retiring Docker containers and how FP and the combo of Cats Effect, FS2 and RabbitMQ helped me, who didn’t use those libs in production before, to go in a fast-forward mode without compromising quality.
And finally, we will try to conclude if functional Scala is a good choice for prototyping the future."

  topic: Practical logic(al) programming with Dotty
  description: "The upcoming Dotty/Scala 3.0 will enable a new level or logic and algebraric programming at the type level.
We will be able to use products and coproducts at the type level. These are the equivalent of tuple and Eithers
at the value level.
After a primer on these new capabilities, we will explore how the FP machinery behind ZIO and
other pure FP libraries can be simplified. The new encodings make complex topics like MonadTransformers approachable
for FP beginners. Some of these techniques push the limits of dotty's type system,
so we will be extending the typechecker through dotty's extension mechanisms."

  topic: "Title: Invertible programs"
  description: "Parsing functionality is commonly available for many languages. Taking text and converting it to the desired structure is a long solved problem.
Invertible parsing is (almost) unavailable. Taking text and converting it to structured data or taking structure and presenting it as text in coherent manner using the same program is solved only in theory.
Until recently. __Invertible__ simply means __can run in both ways__.
 With 'parserz' parser combinators library in Scala one can do just that:
   go from program text to abstract syntax tree and print programs back after optimization done on a tree;
   or express a web server and get a web client for free by simply running the parser logic backwards;
   or even print the description of the parsing program itself to serve as documentation.
Welcome version 0.2 of the library with simpler API, new features and, as usual, made with love."
